                <p>The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America’s most popular dog breed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Labs are friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family. They’re great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you want a loyal, loving, and smart companion, consider adopting one of these pups into your pack.
